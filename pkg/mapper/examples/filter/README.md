> Note: We already have a builtin for `filter` in numaflow Go, but not in Rust.

An example User Defined Function that filter the messages based on expression implemented with `expr` and `sprig` libraries. For more details, check [builtin filter.](https://numaflow.numaproj.io/user-guide/user-defined-functions/map/builtin-functions/filter/)
